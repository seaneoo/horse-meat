## About

This mod adds two new food items, **Raw Horse Meat** and **Cooked Horse Meat**. They can be obtained through multiple
methods:

- Killing a horse (drops 1 -3 raw horse meat).
- Trading with a butcher villager (buy cooked horse meat, sell raw horse meat).
- Looting a butcher village house (chance of 1 - 3 raw horse meat).

The raw meat can be cooked just as raw beef can in vanilla. It also provides the same benefits as raw/cooked beef.
