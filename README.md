## About

This mod adds three new food items, Raw Horse Meat, Cooked Horse Meat, and Horse Meat Burger. The raw and cooked horse meat can be obtained by:

- Killing a horse (drops 1 - 3 raw horse meat).
- Trading with a butcher villager (buy cooked horse meat, sell raw horse meat).
- Looting a butcher village house (chance of 1 - 3 raw horse meat).

The raw meat can be cooked just as raw beef can in vanilla. It also provides the same benefits as raw/cooked beef.

The horse meat burger can be crafted with 1 cooked horse meat and 1 bread. The burger restores 10 hunger and 16 saturation.
